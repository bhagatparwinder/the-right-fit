# The Right Fit
## Finding the right credit card for the job

We all own multiple cards, and these cards come with some lucrative rewards. There have been multiple times when I'm about to make a purchase, and I cannot find the right card for reaping maximum benefit.

My colleague Ben and I decided to solve this problem. Sure, there are few other solutions on the market, but we had the vision to make it quick and easy to look up rewards.
